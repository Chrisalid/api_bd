# Python Api Using Flask

## This API makes a DataBase
  
  The database is made by models.py which generates three tables, they are: Persons, Activity and Users.

## The utils.py File
  
  This file adds, updates, deletes or sees items from each table.

## The app.py file
  
  It uses the Flask API to show the data in the browser via the local server and depending on the method it asks for an authentication using Flask-httpauth.
